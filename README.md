# 🌍 My-Science-Portfolio
A portfolio of science projects and experiments from my gap year, including data analysis, citizen science, and science communication.

Welcome to my portfolio! This is where I document my prjects, learning, and contributions during my gap year. 
My main focus areas are: 
- 🔬 Science communcations (through my blog)
- 📊 Data analysis (using Python, Kaggle, and public databases)
- 🧪 Citizen Acience Projects (Zooniverse, Foldit, EyeWire)
- 💊 Chemistry & biomedical explorations (PubChem, NIH databases)

## 👩🏾‍🔬 About Me 
Hi! I'm Fatima. I'm taking a gap year to explore science in creative ways, gain transferable skills, and build experience for future opportunities in pharmaceuticals, medicine and chemistry. 
This is my "Lab notebook" - a collection of prjects, code, notes, and certificates.
